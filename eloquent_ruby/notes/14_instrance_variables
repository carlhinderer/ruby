- Class Variables

    - Class variables are associated with the class, not an instance of it.

        class Resume < Document
          @@default_font = :arial

          ...
        end


    - Class variables aren't often used, due to some peculiarities about how they are resolved.
        To resolve them, the interpreter starts with the subclass and moves up the inheritance
        hierarchy until the variable is found.  If it is not found, it is set on the class it is
        called on.



- Class Instance Variables

    - Class instance variables are usually used instead.

        class Document
          @default_font = :times

          def self.default_font=(font)
            @default_font = font
          end

          def self.default_font
            @default_font
          end

          ...
        end


    - This can be used to set variables at the class level without having to worry about what happens
        in the rest of the inheritance hierarchy.  Technically, this is an instance variable on the 
        class object.

        Document.default_font = :arial

      Then, it's easy to get the 'Document' class's default font:

        def initialize(title, author)
          @title = title
          @author = author
          @font = Document.default_font
        end



- Class Instance Variables and Subclases

    - We can override a class instance variable in a subclass without changing the value in the
        superclass.

        class Presentation < Document
          @default_font = :nimbus

          class << self
            attr_accessor :default_font
          end

          def initialize(title, author)
            @title = title
            @author = author
            @font = Presentation.default_font
          end
        end


    - Then, we can get the default font for either class:

        Document.default_font
        Presentation.default_font


    - Since class instance variables are just plain instance variables attached to a class object,
        we can use the usual 'attr_accessor' method so that we don't have to add a getter or setter.  
        That is what we're doing here:

        class << self
          attr_accessor :default_font
        end



- Class Instance Variable Examples

    - Active Record callbacks are stored in class instance variables.

        class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
          after_save :handle_after_save

          def handle_after_save
            # Do something
          end
        end
